•	“SignificanceTest.R”
The document is used for selecting significant survival prognostic network markers (SPNs) through the results of three 100 trials.
Input: the results of three 100 trials; the subnetworks obtained from “MainCode.R” initiated from each gene; corresponding scores of subnetworks;
Output: significant survival prognostic network markers (SPNs).
•	“SurvialAnalysis.R”
The document is used for survival analysis of patients based on identified subnetwork markes.
Input: SPNs identifed after the three tests; the gene expression data of breast cancer patients; survival time of breast cancer patients;
Output: the results of survival analysis including the survival curves, the classification of patients, and the P-value of log-rank test.
•	“FisherTest.R”
The document is the program used for Fisher exact test in BP sets and KEGG pathway sets.
Input: significant survival prognostic network markers (SPNs); KEGG pathway sets; Biological process (BP) sets;
Output: enrichment of SPNs in KEGG pathway sets and BP sets.
•	“MyImageFunction.R”
The document is used for plotting the enrichment results in BP sets and KEGG pathway sets.
Input: the enrichment result of SPNs in BP sets and KEGG sets;
Output: the plots showing the enrichment result of SPNs in BP sets and KEGG sets.
